      <p class="lead">Rather than bore you with all the pointless information about how long it has taken me to code all these pages individualy, I am going to bore you with how my life has been going instead.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            First of all, I have just been made full time at my place of work! Included within this is my promotion to Project Coordinator. This may not seem important or at all interesting to some but it is literally a life changing role for me.
            <br/>
            For someone who has literally had no clue in what or where I was going career wise, I can honestly say that I am happy that I have found a job that I love so much! I am now working alongside great individuals who have transformed the way I have always known work to be. Work for me has always been the monotonous task that I have completed everyday just in order to buy things that I want or to pay my bills. Since joining Addvance IT, I have found a passion that has made going to work a joy. As well as this, I have been introduced to a career path that really does interest me and has become something I want to persue further.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Considering I was just some kid who dropped out of University in Wales simply because I was too depressed going to my lectures and not having any drive for anything within the IT industry, my new career has re-ignited that passion once again. I have now found an interest that has not only made me happy but has put me onto a career path that I know I would be happy doing for a very long time.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What else has happened in my life that anyone who may read this might be interested in?
            <br/>
            Well in all honestly, not anything that interesting... I have moved out from my parents house to live with my girlfriend who literally makes me the happiest man on earth. One thing I have become more interested in, aside from my new career has been mobile technology. Now with new phones coming out left right and center, it is almost impossible for me to be able to afford everything I want whilst still owning a car and renting the flat. However the new technology from companies such as One Plus has gotten me very excited!! Although I currently am using the Google Pixel 2 XL, the One Plus phones have caught my eye since I got my OP5 sometime last year. With the One Plus 6 being teased on the website I can't help but become excited for the new phone that I will more than likely purchase much to the disappointment of my girlfriend but I am willing to take that considering I get a new gadget to play with.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Whilst I don't know what my future holds, currently I can say life is good and I am undoubtably happy with where I am, I would like to see where I would be in another year or two, just to see where I am. Anyways I don't kow if anyone will ever read this unless they have come from my twitter where I may or may not have posted this, but I hope you have enjoyed this little read and if you do like it please tweet me and let me know as I really don't know what to do with this domain name!
