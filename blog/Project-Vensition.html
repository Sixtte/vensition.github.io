      <p class="lead">The Vensition.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A type of transition used in VFX work, which allows in a unique style of change in the composition. This new style of change is why I am creating <a href="https://www.vensition.com">Vensition.com</a>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            While I have been struggling to think of something to do with this domain, I have now found something that I want to create as well as maintain a blog of some form. From here on out I will have a place where I can rant about what's going on and the what is going through my mind. Vensition will be the new home of the blog but it will also contain something extra that I want to incorporate, Iridescent Minds will continue to be related to that of creativity, this will be more of a testing stage for me before it goes live as well as be based around its own brand.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Although the new aspect of the vensition project will take me a long time to code moreso than anything else, I do hope that it will allow me to venture into something new and create a potential hobby for me. Until that day when it is created, everything will remain as a blog until then.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Moving onto other things.. I will soon be making a trip to brussels. Considering the farthest I have flown by myself is Endinburgh, I am more than a little nervous for the trip. While I am nervous, I am incredibly excited to be going. Not only because I can help on a project for work but also because I can then travel and see a different country that I wouldn't normally get to and I hope that I can continue and maybe rack up a total of places visited that rivals my dad, although he does have a rather big headstart on me.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Another thing I want to get more involved with it graphic design. The reason for this is because I want to be able to create my own logo and branding but I am just not good enough to do that yet. I can't even draw something out and then attempt to make it in photoshop or illustrator because I can't draw. Abii did some logo ideas the other day and they were all better than what I could come up with. I aspire to be that good at creating something out of nothing and being able to do it out of the blue.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Well that's all I have to say for now but please stay tuned! They are more things I want to say so will be probably be following up with a new post tomorrow, depending on if I want to stop blobbing and type it up as well as work on the new project.
            <br/>
