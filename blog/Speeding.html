      <p class="lead">So this week I got a speeding ticket, this was a real wake up call for me and also scaring the ever living shit out of me at the same time.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Due to the aspects of my job I need to be driving and have a valid driving license. This recent speeding ticket to me was a huge wake up call for my driving. As I was going to Aintree for the Grand National I got caught going 58 in a 50 zone and this has really shook me up and made me think about how I need to be driving.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After this ticket I am now going to be taking extra care on how I drive and making sure I follow the limit.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Although not many things have happened since my last post with the exception of the speeding ticket there have still been some developments that might be worth updating you about.
            <br/>
            While I am becoming more and more interested in making this a blog website more than anything I still want to focus on some VFX work. I have recently been watching Corridor Digital on YouTube and it has really made me want to have a house which me and Abii can make our own. I really want to be able to have our own a place and have access to the funds to create a space that is contemporary and with a stylish-esque sort of setting for me to relax.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Hopefully sometime this year I would like to move from our current flat to a much bigger house where we have our own kitchen area and then a living room. I would like to have a nice place which we could make our own and have a drive and this would be a place I would like to stay and be there so we can start to have a family and have a place that is more comfortable for us.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            While this has been a short blog this week, I hope you have enjoyed this short read. While I try to think of something to type each week that is interesting I have become stuck with trying to find something to talk about as my life really isn't that interesting to talk about. However I will keep trying to find something to talk about on this blog.
            <br/>

            Thanks,
