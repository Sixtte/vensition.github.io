      <h1 class="mt-5">The Races</h1>
      <p class="lead">This week I went to the races. Working for my company I had the priviledge of attending The Grand National, while this was mostly for a support aspect I was able to attend one of the largest events I have been to. While I was on-site at the racecourse a full week before the first race took place I was helping to set up our kit as well as also having chance to take in the sights of Aintree where the grand national was being held.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It's kind of surreal to be at a giant racecourse such as Aintree and seeing it completely dead and then coming into work the next day with over 70,000 people attending. For someone who has anxiety being surrounded by 70,000 people is quite a daunting feat. While I don't have to talk to a fraction of these people I still have to navigate past the sea of people queuing at the bars waiting for a drink and then having to try and force my way through so that I can assist those behind the bar who are having technical difficulties with the equipment. With the opportunity to see the grand national from this perspective rather than just watching on tv and having a bet with your family over a fiver, you have the chance to win a Range Rover for just dressing fancy (something that I will do terribly at no matter how hard I try) but there is still the possibility of me soaking up some of the wealth that is floating around maybe?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Moving away from the Grand National and horse racing, other things that I have been keeping my eye on are the One Plus 6 teases and how they are changing onto the new new url of <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/">OnePlus.com</a>. With this change it marks a new era for them as they become more popular and mainstream especially when it comes to the flagship phones they have in development. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Other things that have I have been thinking about include what I am going to do with this website. As the only thing I have an interest for outside of work is working on this website. I am more running towards is making this little blog page into the main aspect of the website and moving it away from Visual effects based work, despite still wanting to do some VFX I just cannot be bothered.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            While not fully certain about what I want to do with my website, I can feel as though it will allow me to progress my development skills and get further into designing the website I want. Once again, if you have any suggestions on where you want to see the site go or what I could turn it into. <a href="https://twitter.com/AIexWilson">Tweet Me.</a>
