            <p>This week I have been suffering at the Henley Royal Regatta.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite it being absolutely wonderful weather, it has not been enjoyable at all. As I have been working during the event I have been wearing all black for seven straight days. During these seven days I have been walking in and out of ridiculously hot bars in tents that have no A/C or anything to cool staff down.
            <br>
            <br>
            It has been so so hot and I have been struggling with the heat all week often walking back to my hotel room on the brink of passing out from heat exhaustion. The only plus side to this is that I got to watch the England match sat in front of the aircon to see us win 2-0.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the regatta, I have just been trying to find the coolest place to hide in between my bouts of walking around the bars. I have found one safe space which I can go to however it quite varies of how long I do get to stay here for before the next call out is made for me.
            <br>
            <br>
            In other newsone thing I have been trying to get hold of is an Iphone 7 Plus. My reason for wanting one despite having enough phones is so that I can get back into the Apple ecosystem. From this I will have it alot easier when it comes to talking to clients and messaging people, it will also aid me with my reason for wanting to get the Apple EarPods. The reason I want these is because it is such a decent pair of headphone and despite looking for cheaper alternatives that look decent, I am yet to come across any.
            <br>
            <br>
            From this I have been looking on ebay to find one that is cheap and within my budget. Don't trust schpopck ever if you are considering looking for something, they can enforce anything and they do not adhere to GDPR or anything like that. Aside from that, I dont really have much clue about that I am going to do.
