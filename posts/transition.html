            <p>Why did I switch to the One Plus 6?
                <br>
                <br>
                Alot of reasons really, but there is a much bigger reason as to why I made the One Plus 6 my daily driver...
                <br>
                <br>
                Almost since it's release I have been using the Google Pixel 2 as my daily driver. Taking over from the One Plus 5 I was happy that it got the latest versions of Andriod as it came out and allowed me to completely test out a full screen phone and being the first phone I have ever used to put the fingerprint scanner on the back, and I love it... for a while at least.
                <br>
                <br>
                Over time I began to miss things about my One Plus, like the brilliantly designed Oxygen OS that allowed me to customise my phone while still keeping the stock andriod look and feel, all without having to download a third party launcher. To get the Pixel just how I wanted it, I needed to download Nova Launcher and mess around with all the settings in that just to get it to a state that I like, which was pretty much almost identical to my One Plus 5 using stock Oxygen OS (With an Icon change of course). 
                <br>
                <br>
                Other things that bothered me was that I was still engaging in the One Plus Community and could see so many cool things that was going on and not being able to test them or download the latest beta versions and play around with, all because instead of getting the 5T; I got the Pixel... I knew that the second the OP6 was announced that I would be getting that phone and you can see how dedicated I was to that saying as I wrote about this in a blog post months ago. <a href="http://iridescentminds.co.uk/blog/First-Post">See Here.</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                The biggest factor of all for me however was the speed of the phone.. This is what made me definately decide that I wanted to make the One Plus 6 my daily driver. After running both phones on the Andriod P beta the Pixel just couldnt keep up. The One Plus had stayed just as fluid from the day that I got it, all while I was playing CPU intensive games on it daily and flashing it with the latest Beta builds. The One Plus 6 has seriously out performed the Google Pixel two and even after the stable version of Andriod Pie has come out on the Pixel and there are no longer crashes on the phone, the One Plus still using a developer Preview knocks the Pixel out the park in terms of performance and looks in my opinion.
                <br>
                <br>
                This topped with the fact that One Plus will be bringing out the stable Andriod P OTA shortly is what has cemented this phone as my Daily Driver.
                <br>
                <br>
                Truly, the speed you need.
